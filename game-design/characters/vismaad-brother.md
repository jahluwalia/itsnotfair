## Sound Effects
**Movement sounds:** Quick little footsteps, giggling
**Voice lines:** "Hehe", "Uh oh", "Not fair!", "Why??"
**Alert sound:** Loud "WHAT?!"
**Special sound:** "Pew pew" mouth sounds

## Unfairness Connection
**How do they suffer from unfairness?**
- "You're too young" for everything fun
- Bedtime is earlier than sister's
- Can't reach anything important
- Gets hand-me-downs
- "When you're older" (but when??)
- Sister gets to boss him around

**Typical unfair scenario:**
Vismaad has been good all day. Sister was grumpy. Bedtime comes: "Niroop, you can read for 20 more minutes. Vismaad, bed now." "But I was good!" "You need more sleep, you're younger."

## Kids' Design Notes
### Vismaad's Ideas (self):
**Drawing:** "Give me a cape! And laser eyes!"
**Personality ideas:** "I'm super fast and really smart"
**Funny things they should do:** Superhero landing pose

### Niroop's Ideas:
**Drawing:** Brother covered in dirt and holding 10 snacks
**Personality ideas:** "He's annoying but funny"
**Funny things they should do:** Trips over his own feet sometimes

## Technical Notes

**Animation frames:** 10 per animation (more energetic)
**Special requirements:** 
- Smaller hitbox (can fit through gaps)
