# Character Design: Mom

## Basic Info
**Name:** Mom
**Age:** Adult
**Role:** Parent/Authority Figure (Obstacle)

## Appearance
**Description:**
Professional but casual - business casual clothes even at home. Hair in a practical ponytail. Always has phone in hand for "just one more email." Yoga pants for "comfort" but somehow moves faster than kids expect.

**Size:** Medium
**Color Scheme:** Purple/burgundy top, dark pants, phone glowing blue

## Personality
**Three Words:** Organized, Multitasking, All-knowing

**Catchphrase:**
- "I have eyes in the back of my head!"
- "Nice try, but I have parent radar!"
- "Don't make me count to three..."
- "Because I'm the mom, that's why!"

**Quirks:**
- Can somehow hear candy wrappers from three rooms away
- Appears instantly when someone opens the snack cabinet
- Uses full names when serious: "Niroop Singh! Vismaad Kaur!"
- Schedules fun ("We'll have spontaneous fun from 3-4 PM")

## Gameplay Abilities
### As Parent/Authority:
**Patrol Style:**
- [x] Back and forth
- [x] Random wander
- [ ] Circle pattern
- [ ] Stands still, rotates
- [ ] Follows noise

**Detection Range:** Long (can sense mischief from afar)
**Chase Speed:** Fast (yoga finally paid off)
**Give Up Time:** Never (will remember this tomorrow)

**Special Abilities:**
- "Mom Sense" - Detection range doubles when near cookies/candy
- "The Look" - Freezes kid in place for 1 second when caught
- "Phone Distraction" - Occasionally stops to answer work email (kids can sneak past)

## Animations Needed
- [x] Idle (checking phone)
- [x] Walk/Move (power walk)
- [x] Run (surprisingly athletic)
- [ ] Sneak (N/A)
- [x] Spotted/Alert (phone drops, hands on hips)
- [x] Catch/Caught ("The Look")
- [ ] Victory (N/A)
- [ ] Defeat (N/A)
- [x] Special ability (counting to three gesture)

## Sound Effects
**Movement sounds:** Quick footsteps, keys jingling
**Voice lines:** "Hmm?", "What was that?", "I heard that!"
**Alert sound:** Sharp gasp
**Special sound:** Phone notification ding

## Unfairness Connection
**How do they make things unfair?**
- Changes rules without notice ("New rule: No snacks after 7!")
- Different standards for different kids ("Your sister is older")
- Uses "Because I said so" as final argument
- Work calls interrupt kid time ("Sorry honey, I have to take this")

**Typical unfair scenario:**
Kids are about to win the level, Mom gets work call, suddenly declares "Early bedtime tonight, important meeting tomorrow!" Timer suddenly decreases by 2 minutes.

## Kids' Design Notes
### Niroop's Ideas:
**Drawing:** Mom with superhero cape made of yoga mat
**Personality ideas:** "She always knows but pretends not to know"
**Funny things they should do:** Check invisible watch when kids ask for 5 more minutes

### Vismaad's Ideas:
**Drawing:** Mom juggling phone, coffee, laptop, and laundry
**Personality ideas:** "She can teleport to wherever we're being sneaky"
**Funny things they should do:** Hair gets frizzier as she gets more suspicious

## Technical Notes
**Sprite size:** 40x56
**Animation frames:** 8 per animation
**Special requirements:** 
- Needs "distracted" state for phone calls
- Vision cone widens when suspicious
- Speed boost when saying child's full name
