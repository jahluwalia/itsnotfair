# Character Design: Dad

## Basic Info
**Name:** Dad
**Age:** Adult
**Role:** Parent/Authority Figure (Obstacle)

## Appearance
**Description:**
Cargo shorts in all weather. Band t-shirt from a concert 20 years ago. Slightly messy hair. Dad sneakers (white New Balance). Always has a cold brew coffee, even at 9 PM.

**Size:** Large
**Color Scheme:** Green/khaki shorts, band t-shirt (black), white sneakers

## Personality
**Three Words:** Goofy, Strict-but-soft, Dad-jokes

**Catchphrase:**
- "Back in my day..."
- "Don't tell Mom, but..." (Mom always knows)
- "Hi Hungry, I'm Dad!"
- "Bedtime means bedtime, kiddo!"
- "This hurts me more than it hurts you" (it doesn't)

**Quirks:**
- Makes dad jokes at the worst times
- Falls asleep watching TV but wakes up instantly if channel changes
- "Fixes" things that aren't broken
- Air drums to music only he can hear
- "Quick nap" on couch becomes 2-hour snore fest

## Gameplay Abilities
### As Parent/Authority:
**Patrol Style:**
- [x] Back and forth
- [ ] Random wander
- [x] Circle pattern (around his chair)
- [x] Stands still, rotates (guarding TV)
- [ ] Follows noise

**Detection Range:** Medium (unless TV is on, then Short)
**Chase Speed:** Normal (bad knee from "the old football days")
**Give Up Time:** Quick (gets winded, "I'm getting too old for this")

**Special Abilities:**
- "Dad Reflexes" - Catches falling objects (or kids) automatically
- "Thermostat Sense" - Knows immediately if someone touched it
- "TV Trance" - Becomes distracted by sports/news (30% slower detection)
- "Dad Joke Stun" - Bad pun makes kids groan and slow down

## Animations Needed
- [x] Idle (sipping coffee, checking phone for scores)
- [x] Walk/Move (dad shuffle)
- [x] Run (awkward jog)
- [ ] Sneak (N/A)
- [x] Spotted/Alert (coffee spills)
- [x] Catch/Caught (finger wag)
- [ ] Victory (N/A)
- [ ] Defeat (N/A)
- [x] Special ability (dad joke delivery pose)

## Sound Effects
**Movement sounds:** Heavy footsteps, keys and coins jingling
**Voice lines:** "Hmm", "Hey!", "What's going on here?"
**Alert sound:** Coffee mug hitting table
**Special sound:** Dramatic dad sneeze (ACHOO!)

## Unfairness Connection
**How do they make things unfair?**
- Arbitrary rules ("No running in the house" while chasing you)
- Falls asleep during your TV time but wakes up for his show
- "Ask your mother" loop with Mom's "Ask your father"
- Eats the last cookie while enforcing "no snacks before dinner"

**Typical unfair scenario:**
Dad is "resting his eyes" on the couch. Kids try to sneak past to get snacks. The moment they grab cookies, Dad (still with eyes closed): "I don't think so!" Instantly teleports to kitchen.

## Kids' Design Notes
### Niroop's Ideas:
**Drawing:** Dad with tool belt but all tools are TV remotes
**Personality ideas:** "Pretends to be asleep but sees everything"
**Funny things they should do:** Air guitar when he catches you

### Vismaad's Ideas:
**Drawing:** Dad juggling coffee, phone, and TV remote
**Personality ideas:** "Makes jokes when we get in trouble"
**Funny things they should do:** Victory dance that's really embarrassing

## Technical Notes
**Sprite size:** 44x60
**Animation frames:** 6 per animation (slower than Mom)
**Special requirements:** 
- Needs "fake sleep" state
- Slower movement but wider patrol area
- Special "turbo dad" mode when thermostat is touched
- Coffee glass is separate sprite (can be thrown as projectile detection)
