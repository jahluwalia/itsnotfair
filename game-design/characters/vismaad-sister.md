## Unfairness Connection
**How do they suffer from unfairness?**
- Has more responsibilities but same bedtime
- Gets in trouble for brother's messes
- "You're older, you should know better"
- Has to share but brother doesn't
- Parents use her tablet for "important things"

**Typical unfair scenario:**
Vismaad negotiated for 30 more minutes of screen time yesterday. Today, Mom says "That was yesterday's agreement. Today is different." No explanation why.

## Kids' Design Notes
