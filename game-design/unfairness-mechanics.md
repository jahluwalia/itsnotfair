# Unfairness Mechanics Guide

## Types of Unfairness

### 1. Timing Unfairness
**Description:** Things happen at the worst possible moment
**Examples:**
- WiFi crashes during your turn
- Bedtime right before the boss battle
- Ice cream truck comes after you spent your money
**Game Mechanic:** Timer events, interruptions, sudden rule changes

### 2. Rule Change Unfairness
**Description:** Rules change without warning
**Examples:**
- "New rule: No snacks after 7pm" (it's 7:01)
- "Clean your room first" (wasn't required yesterday)
- "Share with your sibling" (but they don't share with you)
**Game Mechanic:** Mid-level objective changes, new obstacles appear

### 3. Random Unfairness
**Description:** Pure bad luck
**Examples:**
- Rain cancels fun plans but not chores
- You get sick on Saturday, not Monday
- Your controller dies, sibling's doesn't
**Game Mechanic:** RNG events, random obstacles

### 4. Authority Unfairness
**Description:** "Because I said so" - no logic needed
**Examples:**
- No explanation given
- Different rules for adults
- Punishment doesn't fit the "crime"
**Game Mechanic:** Unavoidable consequences, must accept and adapt

### 5. Comparison Unfairness
**Description:** Different treatment between siblings
**Examples:**
- Older sibling gets to stay up later
- Younger sibling gets away with everything
- "They're younger/older, so..."
**Game Mechanic:** Different rules per character, advantages/disadvantages

## How Unfairness Affects Gameplay

### Patience Meter

### Fairness Tokens
**What makes things fair again:**

### Adaptation Mechanics
When unfairness strikes, players can:
1. **Accept it** - Gain patience back slowly

3. **Creative solution** - Find alternative path
4. **Sibling teamwork** - Help each other overcome
