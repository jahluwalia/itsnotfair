# Level: World 4 - Level 4 - Mall Mayhem

## Story Setup
**Kid's Goal:** 
Sneak toys into the shopping cart while parents are distracted by "quick" errands that turn into all-day trips

**Time of Day:** 
Saturday, 11:00 AM ("Just a quick trip")

**Location:** 
Mall - toy store, clothing store, food court, parking lot

## The Unfairness Mechanic
**Type:** 
- [x] Timing (happens at the worst moment)
- [x] Rules (sudden rule change)
- [ ] Randomness (bad luck)
- [x] Authority ("because I said so")
- [x] Comparison (sibling gets different treatment)

**What Happens:**
"We're just getting groceries" becomes clothes shopping. "You can pick one toy" becomes "We're not buying toys today." Meanwhile, Mom buys herself coffee and Dad gets tools.

**Why It's Unfair:**
- Parents buy their stuff but not yours
- "Quick trip" is 3 hours
- Vismaad gets new clothes, you get "you'll grow into it"
- Promised toy store visit gets cancelled

**How It's Delivered:** 
Mom: "Change of plans!" every 5 minutes

## Level Design
**Layout:** 
```
Mall Map:
███████████████████████████████████
█ Toy Store │ Clothes │ Food Court █
█     T     │         │            █
█    ████   │   Mom   │            █
█           │         │      T     █

```

**Collectibles:**
- Main tokens: 3 "Can we buy this?" tokens
- Bonus tokens: Play area tickets (worth 2 tokens!)
- Hidden items: Free samples (energy boost)

## Characters in This Level
**Parents/Adults:**
- Mom: Shopping mode - moves between stores unpredictably
- Dad: Follows Mom but gets distracted by tools/electronics

**Obstacles:**
- Other shoppers (block paths)
- Security guard (suspicious of kids alone)
- Store clerks ("Can I help you?" = detection)
- Vismaad: In fitting room forever

**Helpers:**
- Crowds to blend into
- Sample stands create distractions
- Play area = safe zone

## Win/Lose Conditions
**Success:** 
Get 3 items into cart without parents noticing

**Failure:** 
Caught 3 times = "No mall trips for a month!"

**Partial Success:** 
1 item = "Maybe next time..."

## Dialogue/Text
**Start message:**
"Just a quick trip... sure, Mom. That's what you said last time!"

**Parent catch phrase:**
- Mom: "Put that back RIGHT NOW!"
- Dad: "We discussed this in the car!"
- Security: "Where are your parents?"

**Success message:**
"Score! They didn't notice until checkout!"

**Failure message:**
"Another Saturday wasted... and no toys."

## Comedy Elements
**Visual gags:**
- Parents' cart gets comically full
- Niroop hides among mannequins
- Dad gets lost, asks mall map for help
- Mom's "quick trip" timer shows 3+ hours

**Sound effects:**
- Muzak gets increasingly irritating
- "SALE! SALE! SALE!" announcements
- Intercom: "Parents, please control your children"

**Animation ideas:**
- Niroop does mannequin challenge
- Vismaad emerges from fitting room with 50 items
- Parents' hypocritical purchases float above cart

## Difficulty Settings
**Easy:** 
- Parents shop slower
- More crowds to hide in
- Security is lazy

**Normal:** 
- Standard parent awareness
- Normal crowd patterns
- Must avoid security

**Unfair Mode:** 
- Parents have eyes in back of head
- Every store employee is watching
- Vismaad actively points you out
- Cart has squeaky wheel
- "Lost child" announcement when you're alone

## Kids' Ideas Section
### Niroop's Ideas:
- "Add a pretzel stand we can hide behind"
- "Mom should lose us and panic"
- "Make Dad carry all the bags and move super slow"

### Vismaad's Ideas:
- "Can I ride in the cart?"
- "Add a toy store with a test play area"
- "Security guard should chase the wrong kid"

## Parent Notes
- Crowd mechanics and blending in
- Multiple objectives (different stores)
- Social stealth elements
- Time pressure (mall closes)
- Commentary on "quick trips"

## Playtesting Notes
<!-- To be filled after kids play -->
- Is the mall layout clear?
- Do kids understand crowd blending?
- Are the parents' hypocrisies funny?
- Is the level too long?
