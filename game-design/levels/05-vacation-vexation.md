# Level: World 5 - Level 5 - Vacation Vexation (Grand Finale)

## Story Setup
**Kid's Goal:** 
Collect "Pool Time" tokens and "Stay Up Late" passes during family vacation where all rules are supposedly "relaxed"

**Time of Day:** 
Vacation Day 3, 7:00 PM (Peak unfairness time)

**Location:** 
Hotel - pool area, hotel room, lobby, breakfast area

## The Unfairness Mechanic
**Type:** 
- [x] Timing (happens at the worst moment)
- [x] Rules (sudden rule change)
- [x] Randomness (bad luck)
- [x] Authority ("because I said so")
- [x] Comparison (sibling gets different treatment)

**What Happens:**
EVERYTHING goes wrong:
- Pool closes early for "maintenance" (adults still swimming)
- Room service kids menu is "unavailable"
- Bedtime is EARLIER because "travel is tiring"
- WiFi works for parents' devices only
- Kids club is full but adult spa is open

**Why It's Unfair:**
- It's VACATION but more rules than home
- Every fun thing costs extra or is "broken"
- Parents relax while kids have schedules
- "Family time" means watching parents' shows

**How It's Delivered:** 
Hotel speakers, text messages, door signs change randomly

## Level Design
**Layout:**
