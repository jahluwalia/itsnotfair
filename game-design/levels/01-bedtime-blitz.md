# Level: World 1 - Level 1 - Bedtime Blitz

## Story Setup
**Kid's Goal:** 
Collect "5 More Minutes" tokens to finish the boss battle in your game before mandatory bedtime

**Time of Day:** 
8:00 PM (Niroop's bedtime), 9:00 PM (Vismaad's bedtime)

**Location:** 
Upstairs hallway, kids' bedrooms, parent's room, bathroom

## The Unfairness Mechanic
**Type:** 
- [x] Timing (bedtime during boss battle)
- [ ] Rules (sudden rule change)
- [ ] Randomness (bad luck)
- [x] Authority ("because I said so")
- [x] Comparison (sibling gets different treatment)

**What Happens:**
Halfway through the level, Mom announces: "Actually, bedtime is now 7:45 because of daylight savings!" Timer drops by 15 minutes instantly.

**Why It's Unfair:**
- Vismaad gets an extra hour but "she's older"
- No warning about the time change
- You were just about to beat the boss!

**How It's Delivered:** 
Mom yells from downstairs, then appears at top of stairs

## Level Design
**Layout:** 
```
Upstairs Hallway Map:
████████████████████████████
█ B           █ Mom&Dad Rm █  B=Bathroom (hiding spot)
█             ████████████ █  
█      T                 T █  T=Token
█ ████████    ████████    █  
█ Vismaad Rm  Niroop Rm   █  
█ ████████    ████████    █  
█                         █
█         Stairs          █
█    M ←→        D        █  M=Mom patrol, D=Dad position
████████████████████████████
```

**Collectibles:**
- Main tokens: 3 "Five More Minutes" tokens in hallway
- Bonus tokens: 1 "Story Time" token in parent's room (worth 10 minutes!)
- Hidden items: Game controller under bed (achievement)

## Characters in This Level
**Parents/Adults:**
- Mom: Patrols between stairs and bathroom, checking each room
- Dad: Guards the stairs, occasionally goes to bathroom

**Obstacles:**
- Creaky floorboard near parent's room (alerts them)
- Vismaad: Might tattle if she sees you (unless bribed with tokens)
- Night light in hallway (creates visible zone)

**Helpers:**
- Vismaad: Can create distraction by asking for water (once per level)

## Win/Lose Conditions
**Success:** 
Collect 3+ tokens and make it back to your room

**Failure:** 
Caught 3 times = "Straight to bed, no story, no tablet tomorrow!"

**Partial Success:** 
2 tokens = "Fine, 5 more minutes but that's IT!"

## Dialogue/Text
**Start message:**
"Just five more minutes! I'm about to beat the boss!"

**Parent catch phrase:**
- Mom: "Don't make me come up there!"
- Dad: "I'm counting to three... One..."

**Success message:**
"YES! Boss defeated and still got story time!"

**Failure message:**
"No fair! Vismaad's still awake..."

## Comedy Elements
**Visual gags:**
- Kids' exaggerated tiptoe animation
- Parents teleport like horror movie villains
- Vismaad peeks out of room with popcorn

**Sound effects:**
- Floorboard: "CREEEEEEAK" in giant text
- Dad's footsteps shake the screen
- Victory fanfare is 8-bit game music

**Animation ideas:**
- Niroop Naruto-runs back to room
- Mom's hair gets frizzier each time she's alerted
- Dad pretends to sleep but one eye is open

## Difficulty Settings
**Easy:** 
- Parents move 50% slower
- 4 chances before bedtime
- Tokens glow bright

**Normal:** 
- Standard speed
- 3 chances
- Tokens visible but not glowing

**Unfair Mode:** 
- Parents have super hearing
- 1 chance only

## Kids' Ideas Section
### Niroop's Ideas:
- "Mom should check her phone sometimes and get distracted"

- "I should be able to help sometimes if Vismaad shares tokens"

### Vismaad's Ideas:
- "Dad drops his phone and I can hide while he picks it up"

- "Throw stuffed animal to distract"
