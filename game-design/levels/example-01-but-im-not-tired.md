# Level: Tutorial World - 01 - But I'm Not Tired!

## Story Setup
**Kid's Goal:** 
Collect 3 "Five More Minutes" tokens to earn enough time to finish your game before bed

**Time of Day:** 
8:00 PM (Bedtime)

**Location:** 
Living Room and Hallway

## The Unfairness Mechanic
**Type:** 
- [x] Authority ("because I said so")
- [x] Comparison (sibling gets different treatment)

**What Happens:**
Your older sibling gets to stay up until 9 PM, but you have to go to bed at 8 PM sharp. Mid-level, Mom suddenly announces "Actually, bedtime is NOW 7:45!" 

**Why It's Unfair:**
You're only 3 years younger but have to go to bed a whole hour earlier. Plus, the rules keep changing!

**How It's Delivered:** 
Mom calls from the kitchen, then appears in the doorway. Text bubble appears: "New bedtime policy effective immediately!"

## Level Design
**Layout:** 
```
Living Room & Hallway Map:
████████████████████████
█ K                   E█  K=Kid Start, M=Mom, D=Dad
█   ████    ████      █  T=Token, E=Exit (Bedroom)
█      T    █  █  T   █  C=Couch (hiding spot)
█   C       █  █      █  
█           ████      █
█                     █
█  M ←→            D  █  (M patrols, D stands guard)
█                  T  █
████████████████████████
```

**Collectibles:**
- Main tokens: 3 "Five More Minutes" tokens
- Bonus token: Hidden behind couch (worth 10 minutes!)
- Hidden item: Game controller (collect for achievement)

## Characters in This Level
**Parents/Adults:**
- Mom: Patrols left-right in living room, says "Is someone still up?"
- Dad: Guards near bedroom, occasionally checks phone (distracted for 3 seconds)

**Obstacles:**
- Creaky floorboard (makes noise, alerts parents)
- Pet cat (meows if you get too close)

**Helpers:**
- Older sibling (can create distraction once)

## Win/Lose Conditions
**Success:** 
Collect 3 tokens and reach bedroom before "Final Bedtime Timer" expires

**Failure:** 
Caught 3 times = "Straight to bed, no story time!"

**Partial Success:** 
2 tokens = "Okay, 5 more minutes but that's IT!"

## Dialogue/Text
**Start message:**
"But I'm not tired! And Sam gets to stay up until 9!"

**Parent catch phrase:**
- Mom: "Nice try, but I have parent radar!"
- Dad: "Bedtime means bedtime, kiddo!"

**Success message:**
"Yes! Earned enough time to beat the boss!"

**Failure message:**
"Caught! No bedtime story tonight..."

## Comedy Elements
**Visual gags:**
- Kid does exaggerated tiptoe animation
- Parents' eyes glow red when alerted
- Older sibling gives thumbs up from couch

**Sound effects:**
- Cartoonish tiptoe sounds
- "Jaws" theme when parent gets close

## Parent Notes

- Introduce the "unfairness" concept gently with humor
- Should take 2-3 minutes to complete
