# Level: World 2 - Level 2 - Snack Heist Kitchen

## Story Setup
**Kid's Goal:** 
Get the last slice of pizza and hidden cookies before dinner ruins your appetite

**Time of Day:** 
4:30 PM (30 minutes before dinner)

**Location:** 
Kitchen, pantry, living room (Dad watching TV)

## The Unfairness Mechanic
**Type:** 
- [ ] Timing (happens at the worst moment)
- [x] Rules (sudden rule change)
- [x] Randomness (bad luck)
- [ ] Authority ("because I said so")
- [x] Comparison (sibling gets different treatment)

**What Happens:**
When you open the fridge, Mom texts: "New rule: No snacks after 4 PM! Dinner is early today!" Also, Niroop already had cookies but "she had a hard day at school."

**Why It's Unfair:**
- Rule changed AFTER you started
- Sister got snacks already
- Nobody mentioned early dinner
- The pizza will go bad by tomorrow!

**How It's Delivered:** 
Smart fridge displays the message with Mom's face. Alexa announces it too.

**Collectibles:**
- Main tokens: Pizza slice (fridge), Cookie jar (top shelf), Chips (pantry)
- Bonus tokens: Secret candy stash (behind cereal)
- Hidden items: Dad's emergency chocolate (don't get caught!)

## Characters in This Level
**Parents/Adults:**
- Mom: Patrols kitchen, checks fridge every 30 seconds
- Dad: "Watching TV" but gets up during commercials

**Obstacles:**
- Smart fridge: Announces when opened "DOOR OPEN!"
- Alexa: "I heard someone in the kitchen!"
- Squeaky pantry door
- Niroop: Eating HER snacks, might trade for tokens

**Helpers:**
- Can trigger Alexa to play music (covers noise)
- Dad distracted by sports highlights

## Win/Lose Conditions
**Success:** 
Get pizza AND cookies back to room

**Failure:** 
Caught 3 times = "No dessert for a week!"

**Partial Success:** 
Get one snack = "At least I'm not hungry"

## Dialogue/Text
**Start message:**
"I'm starving! And dinner is always gross on Wednesdays..."

**Parent catch phrase:**
- Mom: "The fridge tattled on you!"
- Dad: "Hey! Those are MY snacks!"
- Alexa: "SHALL I ADD VEGETABLES TO YOUR SHOPPING LIST?"

**Success message:**
"Pizza secured! Who needs dinner?"

**Failure message:**
"Brussels sprouts for dinner... again..."

## Comedy Elements
**Visual gags:**
- Vismaad leaves crumb trail
- Dad never takes eyes off TV but arm reaches for you
- Mom appears in fridge reflection like horror movie

**Sound effects:**
- Stomach growling loudly
- Chips bag IMPOSSIBLE to open quietly
- Microwave dings at worst moment

**Animation ideas:**
- Slow-motion pizza grab
- Cookie jar teeters dramatically
- Dad's "snack sense" tingles (spider-sense parody)

## Difficulty Settings
**Easy:** 
- Fridge is silent
- Parents move slower
- Snacks are easier to reach

**Normal:** 
- Standard alerts
- Normal parent speed
- Must use stool for high shelves

**Unfair Mode:** 
- Mom has kitchen cameras on phone
- Dad's show is boring (checks kitchen more)
- Alexa is fully against you
- Floor is COVERED in crinkly chip bags

## Kids' Ideas Section
### Niroop's Ideas:
- "Make the fridge light not work sometimes"
- "Dad should have 'sports rage' and throw popcorn"
- "Add a cat that knocks things over"

### Vismaad's Ideas:
- "I want to eat the snacks to get power-ups!"
- "Dad falls asleep and snores really loud"
- "Hide inside the fridge!"

## Parent Notes
- Introduce noise mechanics
- Multiple paths to success (different snacks)
- Smart home devices as obstacles
- Food makes you faster but noisier
- Kitchen is more complex than bedroom level

## Playtesting Notes
<!-- To be filled after kids play -->
- Is the smart home stuff funny or frustrating?
- Do kids figure out the music distraction?
- Is food collection satisfying?
- Any unfair moments that are TOO unfair?
